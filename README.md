WELCOME TO THE README FOR SHAUN'S WEATHER DASHBOARD!

User Story: AS A traveler, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

This app utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, & multiple Web, 3rd-Party, and Server-Side APis to create a simple weather forecast app. Users can search for a city & state, and are presented with a summary of the current weather conditions, along with a simplified 5-day forecast. Each search term entered by the user is then saved in local storage and displayed on the page as a button they can use to quickly run that search again. Error handling has also been added to validate that the correct search criteria was entered.
